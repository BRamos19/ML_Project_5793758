this term refers to, but is not limited to, general contractor, construction manager, design build contractor, prime contractor, etc. the term is referencing the entity that coordinates the work of other trades. all referenced standards, such as codes, specifications, and other publications noted herein, are intended to refer to the edition of said standard as referenced by the applicable building code or the latest edition published as of the date on the contract documents. the structure is designed to be self-supporting and stable after the building is fully completed. it is solely the contractor's responsibility to determine erection procedure and sequence and insure the safety of the construction personnel, public, building and its component parts, and adjacent buildings and properties. this includes the addition of whatever temporary or permanent shoring, bracing, needling, underpinning, or sheet piling, etc. that may be necessary to brace new construction and adjacent buildings, so that the structure is braced for wind, seismic, gravity, construction loads, etc. and so that no horizontal or vertical settlement or any damage occurs to the adjacent existing structures. temporary supports shall be maintained in place until permanent supports and/or shoring and bracing are installed. design of these supports shall be by an engineer registered in the state where the project is located in the employ of the contractor. fall protection support from perimeter of structure shall be provided in accordance with osha requirements as required. such material shall remain the contractor's property after completion of the project. it is the contractors' responsibility to enforce all applicable safety codes and regulations during all phases of construction.

structure, without causing distress, unanticipated movements or irregular load paths as a result of the construction means and methods employed. construction loads shall not exceed design live loads. the contractor shall be responsible for all design required to support construction equipment used in constructing this project. shoring and re-shoring is the responsibility of the contractor. principal openings through the structure are shown on these drawings. the general contractor shall examine the structural and mechanical, electrical, plumbing and other trades drawings for the required openings and shall verify size and location of all openings with the appropriate trade contractor. providing all openings required for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, or other trades shall be a part of the general contract, whether or not shown in the structural drawings. any deviation from the openings shown on the structural drawings shall be brought to the engineer's attention for review. all contractors are required to examine the drawings and specifications carefully, visit the site and fully inform themselves as to all existing conditions and limitations, prior to agreeing to perform the work. failure to visit the site and familiarize themselves with the existing conditions and limitations will in no way relieve the contractor from furnishing any materials or performing any work in accordance with drawings and specifications without additional cost to the owner. details labeled "typical details on drawings apply to situations occurring on the project that are the same or similar to those specifically detailed. such details apply whether or not details are referenced at each location. notify engineer for clarifications regarding applicability of "typical
