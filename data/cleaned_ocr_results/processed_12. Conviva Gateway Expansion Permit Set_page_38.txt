ceilg.,mechanical, electrical, etc. equipment weight . coordination and dimensions. a. coordinate all dimensions , elevations and conditions between architectural and structural drawings prior to proceeding with the work. verify all dimensions and conditions related to existing conditions in the field prior to construction. bring any discrepancies to the immediate attention of the engineer. written dimensions take precedence over scale. scale is for guideline purposes only. if dimensions are unclear, do not scale. request clarification from the engineer. b. coordinate the structural work with the work of all other trades. c. see architectural plans for all elevations and dimensions not shown. . conflicts in documents: a. all dimensions shall be verified by the contractor in the field prior to construction. if conflicts occur in or between architectural and engineering documents, between documents and field conditions or otherwise, immediately contact the engineer for clarification
