controls schematic diagram sequence of operation system operating modes: the building automation system (bas) shall include a user-adjustable time-of-day schedule to define when the various areas of the facility are expected to be occupied versus unoccupied. then, based on current zone conditions, the bas determines the current system operating mode. occupied heat/cool during the occupied mode, each vav terminal unit varies primary airflow, cycles a terminal fan (if equipped), and/or modulates (or stages) a local or remote heat source (if equipped) to maintain zone temperature at the occupied setpoint (cooling or heating). meanwhile, the rooftop unit (rtu) modulates the supply fan and return fan (if equipped) to deliver the required airflow to the zones, positions the outdoor-air damper to bring in required amount of ventilation, modulates the central relief damper (or relief fan) to maintain building pressure at the desired setpoint, and cycles the compressors, modulates (or stages) the source of heat, and/or enables the airside economizer to discharge air at the desired setpoint. unoccupied heat/cool during the unoccupied mode, each vav terminal unit varies primary airflow, cycles a terminal fan (if equipped}, and/or modulates (or stages) a local or remote heat source (if equipped) to maintain zone temperature at the unoccupied setpoint (cooling or heating). meanwhile, the rtu shuts off, unless a zone requires unoccupied cooling or heating. if needed to operate, the rtu modulates the supply fan and return fan (if equipped) to deliver the required airflow to the zones, closes the outdoor-air damper, closes the central relief damper {or shuts off the central relief fan), and cycles the compressors or modulates (or stages) the source of heat to discharge air at the desired setpoint. morning warm-up/pre-cool during the morning warm-up/pre-cool mode, each vav terminal unit varies primary airflow, cycles a terminal fan (if equipped), and/or modulates (or stages) a local or remote heat source {if equipped) to raise/lower the zone temperature to the occupied setpoint (heating or cooling), and then closes. meanwhile, the rtu modulates the supply fan and return fan (if equipped) to deliver the required airflow to the zones, closes the outdoor-air damper, closes the central relief damper (or shuts off the central relief fan), and cycles the compressors or modulates (or stages) the source of heat to discharge air at the desired setpoint. for a cold-air vav system, if the return air dew point temperature is higher than 55f (adj) during morning pre-cool mode, the discharge-air temperature setpoint will be reset every 10 minutes so that it is only 2f (adj) below the current return air dew point temperature. optimized system-level control sequences: the bas shall perform the following optimized system-level control strategies: optimal start the bas shall initiate optimal start mode such that the rtu is started and vav boxes are enabled to allow the zone temperature to reach the occupied heating or cooling setpoint prior to scheduled occupancy. the system shall wait as long as possible before starting, so that the temperature in each zone reaches the occupied setpoint just in time for scheduled occupancy. optimal stop the bas shall initiate optimal stop mode such that cooling or heating is disabled so that the zone temperature does not drift beyond the occupied standby setpoint by the end of the scheduled occupancy period. the rtu supply fan shall continue operating, and ventilation control shall continue, through the end of the scheduled occupancy period. unoccupied economizing (night purge) between 4:00 am {adj.) and 6:00 am (adj), the bas shall initiate unoccupied economizing mode if the current zone temperature is at least 1f warmer than the occupied cooling setpoint and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is more than 15f (adj) cooler than the current zone temperature. when initiated, the rtu is started (oa damper fully open, compressors off) and vav boxes are enabled to allow the zone temperature to cool to the occupied cooling setpoint. optimized control of supply duct static pressure (fan-pressure optimization) at a frequency of once every 10 minutes, the bas shall monitor the damper position of all vav terminal units. the bas shall calculate a new supply fan duct static pressure setpoint based on the position of the furthest-open vav damper, and send this newly-calculated setpoint to the rtu controller. when any vav damper is more than 75 (adj) open, the supply fan duct static pressure setpoint shall be reset upward by 5 until no damper is more than 75 (adj) open or the static pressure setpoint has reset to the maximum setting. when all vav dampers are less than 65 (adj) open, the supply fan duct static pressure setpoint shall be reset downward by 5 until at least one damper is more than 65 (adj) open or the static pressure setpoint has reset to the minimum setting. optimized control of supply air temperature (sat reset) at a frequency of once every 10 minutes, the bas shall monitor the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, as well as the zone temperature and damper position of all vav terminal units. the bas shall calculate a new sat setpoint based on current outdoor air (oa) temperature, and send this newly-calculated sat setpoint to the rtu controller. when the oa temperature is warmer than 65f (adj), the sat setpoint shall be 55f (adj). when the oa temperature s colder than 55f (adj), the sat setpoint shall be 60f (adj). when the oa temperature is between 55f (adj) and 65f {adj}, the sat setpoint shall be reset proportionally between 55f (adj) and 60f (adj). if at least two (adj) zones have both 1) a vav damper that is more than 75 open, and 2) a current zone temperature that is higher than the current cooling setpoint, then the sat setpoint shall return to 55f (adj) if the outdoor dew point is higher than 60f (adj), this sat reset sequence shall be suspended and the sat setpoint shall be reset to 55f (adj) until outdoor dew point drops below 57f (adj). optimized control of ventilation (ventilation optimization) the actual outdoor airflow shall be sensed at the outdoor air intake of the rtu, and controlled to an airflow setpoint determined according to ashrae standard 62.1. when the bas time-of-day schedule indicates that a zone is unoccupied, the required outdoor airflow for that zone shall be zero. when the schedule indicates that a zone is occupied, the required outdoor airflow for that zone shall equal the design outdoor airflow, unless the zone is equipped with occupancy sensor and/or a carbon dioxide (co2} sensor, or uses a time-of-day ventilation schedule, to reduce the required outdoor airflow during periods of partial occupancy. the required outdoor-air fraction (current required outdoor airflow divided by the current primary airflow) shall be continuously calculated for each zone (vav terminal unit). at a frequency of once every 10 minutes, the bas shall gather this data from all vav terminal units, calculate the minimum required outdoor airflow for the system according to ashrae 62.1, and send this newly-calculated outdoor airflow setpoint to the rtu controller. oa temp/humidity supply air ra/oa act cfm ra temp/humidity filt sts true vav control diagram (rtu-5 air val act vav control diagram
