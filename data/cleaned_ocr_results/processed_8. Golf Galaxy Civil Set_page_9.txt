identified in the intended sequeace of major soil disturbing activities section. provide time frames in which the controls will be implemented. note: all controls shall be consistent with pecformance standards for erosion and scdiment control and stormwater treatment set forth in 3. 62-40.432, flac, the applicable stormwvater or tavironmental resource permitting requirements of the department or a water management diserict, and the guidelines contained in the state of flocida lrosion and sediment conteel designer and reviewer manual, fdot, fdep (2007) and any subsequent amendments,  prior to construction activities the existing packing lot inlets shall protected from sediments by the use of filter fabric and/or sediment contaiament inserts and properly installed geohay inlet filters. disturbed portions of the site where construction activities have permanently ceased shall be stabilized with sod or other permanent stabilization methods (if other methods are used, this swppp will be modified) no later than 14 days after the last construction activity. seeding shall be the same as in temporary secding. these inlet locations are as depicted on the paving, grading and drainage plan shect. describe all temporary and petmanent stabilization practices. stabilization practices include temporary seeding, mulching, permanent seeding, geotestiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, vegetative preservations, etc.  temporary seeding shall be rye grass or other appropriate ground covers depending upon season of installation that is applied at manufacturers recommendations to any disturbed areas that are inactive more than 14 days. permanant stablization inlcudes sod and landscape materials.  filter fabric shall be placed under the rock entrance/exit. describe all structural controls to be inptemented to divert stormwater how from exposed soils and steuctural practices to store nows, retain sediment on-site or in any other way limit stormwater runoff. these controls include silt fences, carth dikes, diversions, swalcs, sediment traps, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, level spreaders, storm drain inkct protection, cock outlet protection, ceinforced soil retaining systems, gabions, coagulating agents and temporary or permanent sediment basins.  a silt fence (with the same installation as indicated under the best management practices heading) shall be placed around the entice perimeter.  inlet(s)/qutfalls shall be protected with filter fabric and properly installed geohay inlet flere (vith the same installation as indicated under the best management practices heading). describe all sediment basing to be implemented for areas that will disturb lo or more acres at one time. i'he sediment basins (or an equivalent alternative} should be able to provide 3,600 cubic feet of storage for each acre drained. temporary sediment basins (or an equivalent altemative) are recommended for drainage areas under [0 acres. no temporary sedimentation basins are proposed. no dewatering activities are anticipated. both sites are part of the existing gatlin plaza surface water management system. describe all permanent stormwater management controls such as, bur not limited to, detention or retention systems or vegetated swales that will be installed ducing the construction process.  both sites are part of the exisiing gatlin plaza surface water mangement system. waste disposal, this may include constuction all construction matecials and debris will be debris, chemicals, liter, and sanitary wastes: placed in a dumpster and hauled off site toa landfill of other proper disposal site. no materials will be buried on site, offsite vehicle tracking from construction off site vehicle tracking of sediments and dust entrances / exits: generation will be minimized via a rack construction entrance, street sweeping and the use of water to kecp dust down. the proper application rates of all fertilizers, florida-friendly fertilizers and pesticides will be herbicides and pesticides used at the construction used at a minimum and in accordance with the site: manufacturets suggested application rates. no fertilizers and pesticides will be stored on site. the starage, application, generation and all paints and other chemicals will be stored in a migration of all toxic substances: locked covered shed. part-o-lets will be placed away from stocm sewer systems, storm inlet(s), sucface waters and wwedands. no vehiele maintenance shall be conducted on-site. a washdown area shall be designated at all times and will not be located in any area that will allow for the discharge of polluted runoff. a small-vegetated berm shall be placed around the washdown area. provide a detailed description of the maintenance plan for all stcuctural and non-structucal controls to assure that they remain in good and effective operating condition. contractor shall provide routine maintenance of permanent and temporary sediment and erosion control features in accordance with the technical specifications or as follows, whichever is more stringent:  silt fence shall be inspected at least weekly. any required repairs shall be made immediately. sediment deposits shall be removed when they reach approximately one-half the height of the barrier.  maintenance shall be performed on the rock entrance when any void spaces are full of sediment.  inlet(s)/outfalls shall be inspected immediately after cach rain event and any required repairs to the peohay filter inlets, silt fence, or filter fabric shall be performed immediately.  bare areas of the site that were previously seeded shall be reseeded per manufacturer's instructions.  muich and sod that has been washed out shall be replaced immediately.  maintain all other areas of the site with proper controls as necessary. inspections: describe the inspection and inspection documentation procedures, as required by part v.d.4. of the permit. inspections must occur at least once a week and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event that is 0.50 inches or greater (see attached ferm). quatified personnel will inspect all points of discharges, all disturbed arcas of construction that have not been stabilized, constructed areas and locations where vehicles enter and exit the site, and all bmps at least once every 7 calendar days or within 24 hours of the end of a rainfall event that is 0.5 inches or greater. where sites have been finally stabilized, said inspections shall be conducted at least once every month unal the notice of termination is filed. identify and desenbe all sources of non-stormwater discharges as alknwed in part [v.a.3. of the permit. mows from fire fighting activities do not have to be listed or described. tt is expected that the folowing non-stormwater discharges may occur from the site during construction period: wash water (where ao spills or leaks of toxic or hazardous materials have occurred), and uncontaminated groundwater (from dewatering excavation). dewatering shall be done in accordance with the requirements of the sfwmi) water use permit (should dewatering be required). if said discharges do occur, they will be directed to the temporary sediment basin prior to discharge. any purnped water shall be treated so as to not allow a discharge of polluted stormwater. i'reatment can include silt fences, setdity: ponds, the proper use of flocculating agents or other appropriate means. all contractor(s) and subcontractor(s) identified in the swppp must sign the following certification: i certify under penalty of law that 1 understand, ard shall comply with, the terms and conditions of the state of florida generic permit for stormwater discharge from large and small
