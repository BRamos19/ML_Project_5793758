equal to 1.5 times the specified design load, no glass breakage or permanent set in the framing members in excess of 0.2 of their clear spans shall occur. 5. seismic: when tested to aama 501.4, system must meet design displacement of 0.010 x the story height and ultimate displacement of 1.5 x the design displacement. 6. thermal movements: allow for thermal movements resulting from the following maximum change (range) in ambient and surface temperatures: a. temperature change (range): 0 deg f; 180 deg f. b. test interior ambient-air temperature: 75 deg f. c. test performance: no buckling; stress on glass; sealant failure; excess stress on framing, anchors, and fasteners; or reduction of performance when tested according to aama 501.5 for a minimum 3 cycles. 7. windborne-debris-impact resistance performance: shall be tested in accordance with astm e 1886, information in astm e 1996 and tas 201/203. a. large-missile impact: for aluminum-framed systems located within 30 feet of grade. b. small-missile impact: for aluminum-framed systems located above 30 feet of grade. mcgarchitecture.com ij a 2  fre lat akaes seal: a project for: warm dark shell casselberry commons 1455
