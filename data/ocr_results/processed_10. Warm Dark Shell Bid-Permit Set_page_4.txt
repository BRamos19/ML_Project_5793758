EXECUTION

SURFACE CONDITIONS:

A. The Contractor shall examine the areas and conditions under which
work of this Section will be provided, shall correct conditions
detrimental to the timely and proper completion of the work, and
shall NOT proceed until unsatisfactory conditions are corrected.

B. Do not commence installation of the work of this Section until
horizontal and vertical alignment of foundation is within 1" of plumb
and the lines shown on the drawings.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS: Protect masonry during construction
from direct exposure to wind and sun when erected in ambient air
temperature of 99 F in shade, and relative humidity less than 50%. Do
not place masonry units when air temperature is below 40 F.
