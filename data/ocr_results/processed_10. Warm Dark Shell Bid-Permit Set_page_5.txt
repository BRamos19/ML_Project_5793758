3. Produce uniform, cross-sectional shapes and depths relative to joint
widths that allow optimum sealant movement capability.

E. Tooling of Non-sag Sealants: Immediately after sealant application and before
skinning or curing begins, tool sealants to form smooth, uniform beads of
configuration indicated. Use tooling agents that are approved in writing by
sealant manufacturer and that do not discolor sealants or adjacent surfaces.

1. Provide concave joint profile per Figure 8A in ASTM C 1193 unless
otherwise indicated.

3.3 FIELD QUALITY CONTROL

A. Field-Adhesion Testing: The Owner shall engage an independent testing
agency to perform field quality control testing. Field test joint-sealant adhesion
to joint substrates as follows:

1. Extent of Testing: Test completed and cured sealant joints as follows:

a. Perform 2 tests for the first 100 feet of joint length for each kind of
sealant and joint substrate.

2. Test Method: Test joint sealants according to Method A, Field-Applied
Sealant Joint Hand Pull Tab, in Appendix X1 in ASTM C 1193.

B. Evaluation of Field-Adhesion-Test Results: Sealants not evidencing adhesive
failure from testing or noncompliance with other indicated requirements will be
considered satisfactory. Remove sealants that fail to adhere to joint substrates
during testing or to comply with other requirements. Retest failed applications
until test results prove sealants comply with indicated requirements.
