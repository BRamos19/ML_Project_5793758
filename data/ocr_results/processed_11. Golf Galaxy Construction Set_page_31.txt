The term General Contractor (G.C.) as used in these documents refers to the Contractor / Construction
Manager in responsible charge of the project in terms of coordination, scheduling, subcontractor
coordination, etc. This term refers to, but is not limited to, General Contractor, Construction Manager,
Design Build Contractor, Prime Contractor, etc. The term is referencing the entity that coordinates the
work of other trades.

All referenced standards, such as codes, specifications, and other publications noted herein, are intended
to refer to the edition of said standard as referenced by the applicable building code or the latest edition
published as of the date on the contract documents.

The structure is designed to be self-supporting and stable after the building is fully completed. It is solely
the contractor's responsibility to determine erection procedure and sequence and insure the safety of the
construction personnel, public, building and its component parts, and adjacent buildings and properties.
This includes the addition of whatever temporary or permanent shoring, bracing, needling, underpinning,
or sheet piling, etc. that may be necessary to brace new construction and adjacent buildings, so that the
structure is braced for wind, seismic, gravity, construction loads, etc. and so that no horizontal or vertical
settlement or any damage occurs to the adjacent existing structures. Temporary supports shall be
maintained in place until permanent supports and/or shoring and bracing are installed. Design of these
supports shall be by an engineer registered in the state where the project is located in the employ of the
contractor.

Fall protection support from perimeter of structure shall be provided in accordance with OSHA
requirements as required. Such material shall remain the contractor's property after completion of the
project.

It is the contractors' responsibility to enforce all applicable safety codes and regulations during all phases
of construction.

The contractor shall perform all construction for the project in a manner and sequence that are based on
accepted industry standards that recognize the interaction of the components that comprise the structure,
without causing distress, unanticipated movements or irregular load paths as a result of the construction
means and methods employed.

Construction loads shall not exceed design live loads. The contractor shall be responsible for all design
required to support construction equipment used in constructing this project. Shoring and re-shoring is the
responsibility of the contractor.

Principal openings through the structure are shown on these drawings. The general contractor shall
examine the structural and mechanical, electrical, plumbing and other trades drawings for the required
openings and shall verify size and location of all openings with the appropriate trade contractor. Providing
all openings required for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, or other trades shall be a part of the general
contract, whether or not shown in the structural drawings. Any deviation from the openings shown on the
structural drawings shall be brought to the engineer's attention for review.

All contractors are required to examine the drawings and specifications carefully, visit the site and fully
inform themselves as to all existing conditions and limitations, prior to agreeing to perform the work.
Failure to visit the site and familiarize themselves with the existing conditions and limitations will in no way
relieve the contractor from furnishing any materials or performing any work in accordance with drawings
and specifications without additional cost to the owner.

Details labeled "Typical Details” on drawings apply to situations occurring on the project that are the same
or similar to those specifically detailed. Such details apply whether or not details are referenced at each
location. Notify engineer for clarifications regarding applicability of "Typical Details".

General (cont.)

14.

15.

Work these drawings with architectural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing drawings, along with all
other drawings and specifications included in the contract documents.

Do not scale drawings.

Any discrepancies between structural and architectural drawings shall be brought to the attention of the
architect and structural engineer.

Should any of the general notes conflict with any details or instructions on plans, or in the specifications,
the strictest provision shall govern.

Shop drawings and submittals:

A. These drawings shall be checked and coordinated with other materials and contracts by the
general contractor and shop drawings and submittals shall bear the contractor's review stamp with
the checker's initials before being submitted to the architect for approval.

B. When the fabricator has been authorized to use the architect's and engineer's drawings as erection
drawings, the fabricator must remove all title blocks, professional seals and any other references to
the architect and engineer from that erection drawing. The fabricator's name and title shall be
placed on the erection drawings.

C. Where dimensions and elevations of existing construction could affect the new construction, it is
the contractor's responsibility to make field measurements in time for their incorporation in the shop
drawings.

Building Pad Preparation

1.

2.

All building pad preparation shall follow the recommendations of the geotechnical report (uno).

All trees, brush, roots, topsoil, rubble, organically contaminated or otherwise objectionable materials
encountered are to be removed from structural areas of the site per the geotechnical report.

Subgrade sectors which will exist in cut and those which are to support fill structures are to be proof
rolled. Areas exhibiting instability are to be undercut and back filled on a lift-by-lift basis with each lift
carefully compacted.

If unstable subgrade sectors cannot be stabilized by excavation and recompaction, then crushed stone or
similar coarse aggregate materials shall be rolled into the subgrade until a firm subgrade reaction is
achieved.

The geotechnical engineer shall determine on site or off site imported material that can be used for
engineered fill. All fill material shall be approved by the geotechnical engineer.

The proposed engineered fill materials are to be placed in lifts not exceeding eight (8) inches in loose
measured thickness. Each lift is to be compacted as follows:

A. Slab on grade: Minimum of 98% maximum density by ASTM D1557.
B. Footings bearing on fill: Minimum of 98% maximum density by ASTM D1557.

The earthwork program shall be conducted under the supervision of a soils testing laboratory. The
in-place densities achieved are to be verified by tests.

Foundation

11.

12.

13.

The contractor shall familiarize themselves with the survey and the geotechnical investigation report
before starting construction. All foundation work shall be in accordance with the recommendations of the
geotechnical report by Terracon, dated Feb. 12, 2021 except where noted otherwise on drawings or
specifications.

A soils testing laboratory shall be retained by the owner to provide construction review to insure
conformance with the construction documents during the excavation, back fill, and foundation phases of
the project.

The soils testing laboratory shall:

e Discuss with the engineer the design intent of the construction documents and the testing
procedures used to ensure conformance with the construction documents before construction
begins.

e Inform the engineer of any variance in these procedures.

It shall be the responsibility of the soils testing laboratory to:

e Determine topsoil and excavation stripping depth;

e Inspect all subsoil exposed during stripping, site grading, and excavation operations;

e Approve fill materials, perform density tests of fills to insure placement per specification
requirements;

e Inspect foundation bearing surfaces.

Foundation design is based on 2500 psf bearing pressure on firm, undisturbed soil.

Top of footing elevations, footing steps and thickness of footings are shown on the drawings and are
based upon the information from the geotechnical report and the civil drawings available at the time of
design. The top and bottom of footing may vary depending on the conditions encountered at the site.
Frost depth shall be maintained and coordinated with final grading and location of footing steps. If proper
foundation bearing is found to be deeper than that shown on the drawings then foundations shall be
thickened maintaining the top of footing elevation to assure proper foundation bearing. The contractor
shall submit unit prices for such work and shall qualify the extent of work in the base bid. If top of footing
elevations need to vary for final site conditions then the general contractor shall coordinate the effort of
other trades.

Step footings, where required, at a ratio of one (1) vertical to two (2) horizontal with a maximum vertical
step of 2'-0" unless noted otherwise.

Inundation and long term exposure of bearing surfaces, which will result in deterioration of bearing
formations, shall be prevented. Footings shall be placed immediately following footing excavations and
bearing surface inspection.

Back filling against restrained walls shall not be permitted until the supporting floors are in place and are
able to resist the imposed lateral forces. Except for cantilever retaining walls or unless noted otherwise on
drawings, the walls are supported by the floor above and below. Proper temporary bracing may be used
in lieu of the floor support based upon the design by a professional engineer. The design of temporary
bracing is the total responsibility of the contractor.

All fill materials shall be free of organic contaminations and other deleterious matter.

For back fill against restrained walls, retaining walls, footings, etc., place in 8” thick layers, with each lift
compacted at near optimum moisture content, until a minimum in place density of 98% of the maximum
density as determined by ASTM D1557 is achieved.

All soil surrounding and under footings shall be protected from frost action and freezing during the course
of construction.

Notify structural engineer of any unusual soil conditions that are in variance with the geotechnical report.
