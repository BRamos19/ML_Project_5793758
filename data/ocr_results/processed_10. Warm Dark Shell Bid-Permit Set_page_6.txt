PART 3 EXECUTION

3.01 EXAMINATION

A. Examine areas and substrates, with Installer present, and including welded
hollow-metal frames, and structural framing, for compliance with
requirements and other conditions affecting performance. Proceed with
installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.

3.02 INSTALLING STEEL FRAMING, GENERAL

A. Installation Standards: ASTM C 754 and ASTM C 840 requirements that
apply to framing installation.

B. Install supplementary framing, blocking, and bracing at terminations in
gypsum board assemblies to support fixtures, equipment services, heavy
trim, or similar construction. Comply with details indicated and with gypsum
board manufacturer's written recommendations or, if none available, with
USG's Gypsum Construction Handbook.

C. Do not bridge building control and expansion joints with steel framing or
furring members. Independently frame both sides of joints with framing or
furring members as indicated.

3.07 INSTALLING TRIM ACCESSORIES

A. General: For trim with back flanges intended for fasteners, attach to framing
with same fasteners used for panels. Otherwise, attach trim according to
accessory manufacturer's written instructions.

B. Install cornerbead at external corners.

C. Install edge trim where edge of gypsum panels would otherwise be exposed.
Provide edge trim type with face flange formed to receive joint compound
except where other types are indicated.

D. Install control joints according to ASTM C 840 in locations indicated on
Drawings.

SECTION 09260 - CONTINUED

3.08 FINISHING GYPSUM BOARD ASSEMBLIES

A. General: Treat gypsum board joints, interior angles, edge trim, control joints,
penetrations, fastener heads, surface defects, and elsewhere as required to
prepare gypsum board surfaces for decoration. Promptly remove residual joint
compound from adjacent surfaces.

B. Prefill open joints, rounded or beveled edges, and damaged surface areas.

C. Apply joint tape over gypsum board joints, except those with trim having flanges
not intended for tape.

D. Gypsum Board Finish Levels: Finish panels to levels indicated below, according
to ASTM C 840, for locations indicated:

1. Level 1: Embed tape at joints in ceiling plenum areas, concealed areas, and
where indicated, unless a higher level of finish is required for
fire-resistance-rated assemblies and sound-rated assemblies.

2. Level 2: Embed tape and apply separate first coat of joint compound to tape,
fasteners, and trim flanges where indicated.

3. Level 4: Embed tape and apply separate first, fill, and finish coats of joint
compound to tape, fasteners, and trim flanges at panel surfaces that will be
exposed to view unless otherwise indicated.

4. Level 5: Embed tape and apply separate first, fill, and finish coats of joint
compound to tape, fasteners, and trim flanges, and apply skim coat of joint
compound over entire surface where scheduled to receive paint unless
otherwise indicated.
