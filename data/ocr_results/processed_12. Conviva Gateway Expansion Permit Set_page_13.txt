stops to maintain glass face clearances and to prevent sealant from extruding into glass channel and blocking weep
systems until sealants cure. Secure spacers or spacers and backings in place and in position to control depth of
installed sealant relative to edge clearance for optimum sealant performance. Force sealants into glazing channels to
eliminate voids and to ensure complete wetting or bond of sealant to glass and channel surfaces. Tool exposed
surfaces of sealants to provide a substantial wash away from glass.
