SEQUENCE OF OPERATION

SYSTEM OPERATING MODES: THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM (BAS) SHALL INCLUDE A USER-ADJUSTABLE TIME-OF-DAY SCHEDULE TO DEFINE WHEN THE
VARIOUS AREAS OF THE FACILITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE OCCUPIED VERSUS UNOCCUPIED. THEN, BASED ON CURRENT ZONE CONDITIONS,
THE BAS DETERMINES THE CURRENT SYSTEM OPERATING MODE.

OCCUPIED HEAT/COOL

DURING THE OCCUPIED MODE, EACH VAV TERMINAL UNIT VARIES PRIMARY AIRFLOW, CYCLES A TERMINAL FAN (IF EQUIPPED), AND/OR MODULATES (OR
STAGES) A LOCAL OR REMOTE HEAT SOURCE (IF EQUIPPED) TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE AT THE OCCUPIED SETPOINT (COOLING OR HEATING).
MEANWHILE, THE ROOFTOP UNIT (RTU) MODULATES THE SUPPLY FAN AND RETURN FAN (IF EQUIPPED) TO DELIVER THE REQUIRED AIRFLOW TO THE ZONES,
POSITIONS THE OUTDOOR-AIR DAMPER TO BRING IN REQUIRED AMOUNT OF VENTILATION, MODULATES THE CENTRAL RELIEF DAMPER (OR RELIEF FAN) TO
MAINTAIN BUILDING PRESSURE AT THE DESIRED SETPOINT, AND CYCLES THE COMPRESSORS, MODULATES (OR STAGES) THE SOURCE OF HEAT, AND/OR ENABLES
THE AIRSIDE ECONOMIZER TO DISCHARGE AIR AT THE DESIRED SETPOINT.

UNOCCUPIED HEAT/COOL

DURING THE UNOCCUPIED MODE, EACH VAV TERMINAL UNIT VARIES PRIMARY AIRFLOW, CYCLES A TERMINAL FAN (IF EQUIPPED}, AND/OR MODULATES (OR
STAGES) A LOCAL OR REMOTE HEAT SOURCE (IF EQUIPPED) TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE AT THE UNOCCUPIED SETPOINT (COOLING OR HEATING).
MEANWHILE, THE RTU SHUTS OFF, UNLESS A ZONE REQUIRES UNOCCUPIED COOLING OR HEATING. IF NEEDED TO OPERATE, THE RTU MODULATES THE SUPPLY
FAN AND RETURN FAN (IF EQUIPPED) TO DELIVER THE REQUIRED AIRFLOW TO THE ZONES, CLOSES THE OUTDOOR-AIR DAMPER, CLOSES THE CENTRAL RELIEF
DAMPER {OR SHUTS OFF THE CENTRAL RELIEF FAN), AND CYCLES THE COMPRESSORS OR MODULATES (OR STAGES) THE SOURCE OF HEAT TO DISCHARGE AIR AT
THE DESIRED SETPOINT.

MORNING WARM-UP/PRE-COOL

DURING THE MORNING WARM-UP/PRE-COOL MODE, EACH VAV TERMINAL UNIT VARIES PRIMARY AIRFLOW, CYCLES A TERMINAL FAN (IF EQUIPPED), AND/OR
MODULATES (OR STAGES) A LOCAL OR

REMOTE HEAT SOURCE {IF EQUIPPED) TO RAISE/LOWER THE ZONE TEMPERATURE TO THE OCCUPIED SETPOINT (HEATING OR COOLING), AND THEN CLOSES.
MEANWHILE, THE RTU MODULATES THE

SUPPLY FAN AND RETURN FAN (IF EQUIPPED) TO DELIVER THE REQUIRED AIRFLOW TO THE ZONES, CLOSES THE OUTDOOR-AIR DAMPER, CLOSES THE CENTRAL
RELIEF DAMPER (OR SHUTS OFF THE CENTRAL

RELIEF FAN), AND CYCLES THE COMPRESSORS OR MODULATES (OR STAGES) THE SOURCE OF HEAT TO DISCHARGE AIR AT THE DESIRED SETPOINT.

FOR A COLD-AIR VAV SYSTEM, IF THE RETURN AIR DEW POINT TEMPERATURE IS HIGHER THAN 55°F (ADJ) DURING MORNING PRE-COOL MODE, THE
DISCHARGE-AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT WILL BE
RESET EVERY 10 MINUTES SO THAT IT IS ONLY 2°F (ADJ) BELOW THE CURRENT RETURN AIR DEW POINT TEMPERATURE.

OPTIMIZED SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL SEQUENCES: THE BAS SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING OPTIMIZED SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL STRATEGIES:

OPTIMAL START

THE BAS SHALL INITIATE OPTIMAL START MODE SUCH THAT THE RTU IS STARTED AND VAV BOXES ARE ENABLED TO ALLOW THE ZONE TEMPERATURE TO REACH
THE OCCUPIED HEATING OR COOLING SETPOINT PRIOR TO SCHEDULED OCCUPANCY. THE SYSTEM SHALL WAIT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BEFORE STARTING, SO
THAT THE TEMPERATURE IN EACH ZONE REACHES THE OCCUPIED SETPOINT JUST IN TIME FOR SCHEDULED OCCUPANCY.

OPTIMAL STOP

THE BAS SHALL INITIATE OPTIMAL STOP MODE SUCH THAT COOLING OR HEATING IS DISABLED SO THAT THE ZONE TEMPERATURE DOES NOT DRIFT BEYOND THE
OCCUPIED STANDBY SETPOINT BY THE END OF THE SCHEDULED OCCUPANCY PERIOD. THE RTU SUPPLY FAN SHALL CONTINUE OPERATING, AND VENTILATION
CONTROL SHALL CONTINUE, THROUGH THE END OF THE SCHEDULED OCCUPANCY PERIOD.

UNOCCUPIED ECONOMIZING (NIGHT PURGE)

BETWEEN 4:00 AM {ADJ.) AND 6:00 AM (ADJ), THE BAS SHALL INITIATE UNOCCUPIED ECONOMIZING MODE IF THE CURRENT ZONE TEMPERATURE IS AT LEAST 1°F
WARMER THAN THE OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT AND THE OUTDOOR DRY-BULB TEMPERATURE IS MORE THAN 15°F (ADJ) COOLER THAN THE CURRENT ZONE
TEMPERATURE. WHEN INITIATED, THE RTU IS STARTED (OA DAMPER FULLY OPEN, COMPRESSORS OFF) AND VAV BOXES ARE ENABLED TO ALLOW THE ZONE
TEMPERATURE TO COOL TO THE OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT.

OPTIMIZED CONTROL OF SUPPLY DUCT STATIC PRESSURE (FAN-PRESSURE OPTIMIZATION)

AT A FREQUENCY OF ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES, THE BAS SHALL MONITOR THE DAMPER POSITION OF ALL VAV TERMINAL UNITS. THE BAS SHALL CALCULATE A
NEW SUPPLY FAN DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT BASED ON THE POSITION OF THE FURTHEST-OPEN VAV DAMPER, AND SEND THIS NEWLY-CALCULATED
SETPOINT TO THE RTU CONTROLLER. WHEN ANY VAV DAMPER IS MORE THAN 75% (ADJ) OPEN, THE SUPPLY FAN DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE
RESET UPWARD BY 5% UNTIL NO DAMPER IS MORE THAN 75% (ADJ) OPEN OR THE STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT HAS RESET TO THE MAXIMUM SETTING. WHEN
ALL VAV DAMPERS ARE LESS THAN 65% (ADJ) OPEN, THE SUPPLY FAN DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET DOWNWARD BY 5% UNTIL AT LEAST
ONE DAMPER IS MORE THAN 65% (ADJ) OPEN OR THE STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT HAS RESET TO THE MINIMUM SETTING.

OPTIMIZED CONTROL OF SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE (SAT RESET)

AT A FREQUENCY OF ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES, THE BAS SHALL MONITOR THE OUTDOOR DRY-BULB TEMPERATURE, AS WELL AS THE ZONE TEMPERATURE AND
DAMPER POSITION OF ALL VAV TERMINAL UNITS. THE BAS SHALL CALCULATE A NEW SAT SETPOINT BASED ON CURRENT OUTDOOR AIR (OA) TEMPERATURE,
AND SEND THIS NEWLY-CALCULATED SAT SETPOINT TO THE RTU CONTROLLER. WHEN THE OA TEMPERATURE IS WARMER THAN 65°F (ADJ), THE SAT SETPOINT
SHALL BE 55°F (ADJ). WHEN THE OA TEMPERATURE |S COLDER THAN 55°F (ADJ), THE SAT SETPOINT SHALL BE 60°F (ADJ). WHEN THE OA TEMPERATURE IS
BETWEEN 55°F (ADJ) AND 65°F {ADJ}, THE SAT SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET PROPORTIONALLY BETWEEN 55°F (ADJ) AND 60°F (ADJ). IF AT LEAST TWO (ADJ) ZONES
HAVE BOTH 1) A VAV DAMPER THAT IS MORE THAN 75% OPEN, AND 2) A CURRENT ZONE TEMPERATURE THAT IS HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT COOLING
SETPOINT, THEN THE SAT SETPOINT SHALL RETURN TO 55°F (ADJ) IF THE OUTDOOR DEW POINT IS HIGHER THAN 60°F (ADJ), THIS SAT RESET SEQUENCE SHALL BE
SUSPENDED AND THE SAT SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET TO 55°F (ADJ) UNTIL

OUTDOOR DEW POINT DROPS BELOW 57°F (ADJ).

OPTIMIZED CONTROL OF VENTILATION (VENTILATION OPTIMIZATION)

THE ACTUAL OUTDOOR AIRFLOW SHALL BE SENSED AT THE OUTDOOR AIR INTAKE OF THE RTU, AND CONTROLLED TO AN AIRFLOW SETPOINT DETERMINED
ACCORDING TO ASHRAE STANDARD 62.1. WHEN THE BAS TIME-OF-DAY SCHEDULE INDICATES THAT A ZONE IS UNOCCUPIED, THE REQUIRED OUTDOOR AIRFLOW
FOR THAT ZONE SHALL BE ZERO. WHEN THE SCHEDULE INDICATES THAT A ZONE IS OCCUPIED, THE REQUIRED OUTDOOR AIRFLOW FOR THAT ZONE SHALL EQUAL
THE DESIGN OUTDOOR AIRFLOW, UNLESS THE ZONE IS EQUIPPED WITH OCCUPANCY SENSOR AND/OR A CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2} SENSOR, OR USES A
TIME-OF-DAY VENTILATION SCHEDULE, TO REDUCE THE REQUIRED OUTDOOR AIRFLOW DURING PERIODS OF PARTIAL OCCUPANCY. THE REQUIRED
OUTDOOR-AIR FRACTION (CURRENT REQUIRED OUTDOOR AIRFLOW DIVIDED BY THE CURRENT PRIMARY AIRFLOW) SHALL BE CONTINUOUSLY CALCULATED FOR
EACH ZONE (VAV TERMINAL UNIT). AT A FREQUENCY OF ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES, THE BAS SHALL GATHER THIS DATA FROM ALL VAV TERMINAL UNITS,
CALCULATE THE MINIMUM REQUIRED OUTDOOR AIRFLOW FOR THE SYSTEM ACCORDING TO ASHRAE 62.1, AND SEND THIS NEWLY-CALCULATED OUTDOOR
AIRFLOW SETPOINT TO THE RTU CONTROLLER.

OCCUPIED MODE:

DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS, THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL RUN CONTINUOUSLY AND THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL OPEN TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS. THE DX COOLING
AND ELECTRIC HEAT SHALL STAGE TO MAINTAIN THE OCCUPIED SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. IF

ECONOMIZING IS ENABLED THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN THE OCCUPIED SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.

UNOCCUPIED MODE:

WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW THE UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT OF 60.0 DEG. F (ADJ.) THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL START, THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL REMAIN CLOSED AND
THE ELECTRIC HEAT SHALL BE ENABLED. WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THE UNOCCUPIED

HEATING SETPOINT OF 60.0 DEG. F (ADJ.) PLUS THE UNOCCUPIED DIFFERENTIAL OF 4.0 DEG. F (ADJ.} THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL STOP AND THE ELECTRIC HEAT SHALL BE DISABLED.WHEN THE SPACE
TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE THE UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT OF 85.0 DEG. F {ADJ.} THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL START, THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL OPEN IF ECONOMIZING IS ENABLED AND
REMAIN CLOSED IF ECONOMIZING IS DISABLED AND THE DX COOLING SHALL BE ENABLED. WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE FALLS BELOW THE UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT OF 85.0 DEG. F
(ADJ.) MINUS THE UNOCCUPIED DIFFERENTIAL OF 4.0 DEG. F (ADJ.) THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL STOP, THE DX COOLING SHALL BE DISABLED AND THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL CLOSE.

OPTIMAL START:

THE BAS SHALL MONITOR THE SCHEDULED OCCUPIED TIME, OCCUPIED SPACE SETPOINTS AND SPACE TEMPERATURE TO CALCULATE WHEN THE OPTIMAL START OCCURS.

MORNING WARM-UP MODE:

DURING OPTIMAL START, IF THE SPACE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW THE OCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT A MORNING WARM-UP MODE SHALL BE ACTIVATED. WHEN MORNING WARM-UP IS
INITIATED THE UNIT SHALL ENABLE THE HEATING AND SUPPLY FAN. THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL REMAIN CLOSED,

WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE REACHES THE OCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT (ADJ.}, THE UNIT SHALL TRANSITION TO THE OCCUPIED MODE.

PRE-COOL MODE:

DURING OPTIMAL START, IF THE SPACE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE THE OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT, PRE-COOL MODE SHALL BE ACTIVATED. WHEN PRE-COOL IS INITIATED THE UNIT SHALL
ENABLE THE FAN AND COOLING OR ECONOMIZER. THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL REMAIN CLOSED, UNLESS

ECONOMIZING. WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE REACHES OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT (ADJ.), THE UNIT SHALL TRANSITION TO THE OCCUPIED MODE.

OPTIMAL STOP:
THE BAS SHALL MONITOR THE SCHEDULED UNOCCUPIED TIME, OCCUPIED SETPOINTS AND SPACE TEMPERATURE TO CALCULATE WHEN THE OPTIMAL STOP OCCURS. WHEN THE OPTIMAL STOP
MODE IS ACTIVE THE UNIT CONTROLLER SHALL MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE TO THE SPACE TEMPERATURE OFFSET SETPOINT.

OCCUPIED BYPASS:

THE BAS SHALL MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE “ON” AND “CANCEL” BUTTONS OF THE SPACE TEMPERATURE SENSOR. WHEN AN OCCUPIED BYPASS REQUEST IS RECEIVED FROM A SPACE SENSOR,
THE UNIT SHALL TRANSITION FROM ITS CURRENT OCCUPANCY MODE TO OCCUPIED BYPASS MODE AND

THE UNIT SHALL MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE TO THE OCCUPIED SETPOINTS (ADJ.).

COOLING MODE:

THE UNIT CONTROLLER SHALL MONITOR SPACE TEMPERATURE AND SPACE TEMPERATURE COOLING SETPOINT TO DETERMINE WHEN TO INITIATE REQUESTS FOR COOLING. WHEN THE SPACE
TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THE SPACE TEMPERATURE COOLING SETPOINT, THE UNIT CONTROLLER

SHALL MODULATE THE ECONOMIZER OR STAGE THE MECHANICAL COOLING ON OR OFF AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE COOLING SETPOINT. THE FIRST COMPRESSOR
SHALL ENERGIZE AFTER ITS MINIMUM 3-MINUTE OFF TIME HAS EXPIRED. THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL MODULATE ABOVE

MINIMUM SPEED TO MEET ZONE REQUIREMENTS. IF ADDITIONAL COOLING CAPACITY IS REQUIRED THE NEXT STAGE OF COOLING SHALL BE ENABLED. ONCE THE SPACE TEMPERATURE FALLS
BELOW THE SETPOINT THE COMPRESSORS SHALL BE DEACTIVATED AND THE FAN SHALL MODULATE TO MINIMUM.

SPEED.

HEATING MODE:

THE UNIT CONTROLLER SHALL MONITOR SPACE TEMPERATURE AND SPACE TEMPERATURE HEATING SETPOINT TO DETERMINE WHEN TO INITIATE REQUESTS FOR HEAT. WHEN THE SPACE
TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW THE SPACE TEMPERATURE HEATING SETPOINT, THE CONTROLLER SHALL ENABLE THE FIRST

STAGE OF HEAT. IF ADDITIONAL HEATING CAPACITY IS REQUIRED THE SECOND STAGE OF HEAT SHALL BE ENABLED. THE SUPPLY FAN WILL REMAIN AT 100% DURING HEATING OPERATION. ONCE
THE SPACE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THE SETPOINT, THE HEATING STAGES SHALL BE DISABLED AND THE

SUPPLY FAN SPEED WILL VARY ACCORDING TO VENTILATION AND COOLING MODES.

ECONOMIZER CONTROL / COMPARATIVE ENTHALPY:

THE SUPPLY AIR SENSOR SHALL MEASURE THE DRY BULB TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR LEAVING THE EVAPORATOR COIL WHILE ECONOMIZING. WHEN ECONOMIZING IS ENABLED AND THE UNIT IS
OPERATING IN THE COOLING MODE, THE ECONOMIZER DAMPER SHALL MODULATE BETWEEN ITS

MINIMUM POSITION AND 100% TO MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. MINIMUM POSITION SHALL BE CALCULATED BASED ON SUPPLY FAN SPEED. IF THE SUPPLY AIR
TEMPERATURE STARTS TO FALL BELOW SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE SETPOINT, THE OUTDOOR DAMPER SHALL BE AT

MINIMUM POSITION. COMPRESSORS SHALL BE DELAYED FROM OPERATING UNTIL THE ECONOMIZER

HAS OPENED TO 100% FOR 5 MINUTES.

COMPARATIVE ENTHALPY:
OUTSIDE AIR ENTHALPY IS COMPARED WITH RETURN AIR ENTHALPY POINT. THE ECONOMIZER SHALL BE ENABLED WHEN OUTDOOR AIR ENTHALPY |S LESS THAN RETURN AIR ENTHALPY - 3.0
BTU/LB. THE ECONOMIZER SHALL BE DISABLED WHEN OUTDOOR AIR ENTHALPY IS GREATER THAN RETURN AIR ENTHALPY.

SUPPLY FAN OPERATION:

THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL BE ENABLED WHILE IN THE OCCUPIED MODE AND CYCLED ON DURING THE UNOCCUPIED MODE. THE UNIT CONTROLLER SHALL VARY THE SUPPLY FAN SPEED TO OPTIMIZE
MINIMUM FAN SPEED IN ALL COOLING MODES, A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL MONITOR THE

DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE FAN. IF THE SWITCH DOES NOT OPEN WITHIN 40 SECONDS AFTER A REQUEST FOR FAN OPERATION A FAN FAILURE ALARM SHALL BE ANNUNCIATED, THE
UNIT SHALL STOP, REQUIRING A MANUAL RESET.

FILTER STATUS:
A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL MONITOR THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE FILTER WHEN THE FAN IS RUNNING. IF THE SWITCH CLOSES FOR 2 MINUTES AFTER A REQUEST FOR
FAN OPERATION A DIRTY FILTER ALARM SHALL BE ANNUNCIATED AT THE BAS.

VAV SEQUENCE OF OPERATION

BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM INTERFACE:

THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM (BAS) SHALL SEND THE CONTROLLER OCCUPIED AND UNOCCUPIED COMMANDS. THE BAS MAY ALSO SEND A HEAT/COOL MODE,
PRIORITY SHUTDOWN COMMANDS, SPACE TEMPERATURE AND/OR SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. IF COMMUNICATION IS

LOST WITH THE BAS, THE VAV CONTROLLER SHALL OPERATE USING ITS LOCAL SETPOINTS.

OCCUPANCY MODE:
THE OCCUPANCY MODE SHALL BE COMMUNICATED OR HARDWIRED TO THE CONTROLLER VIA A BINARY INPUT. VALID OCCUPANCY MODES FOR THE UNIT SHALL BE:

OCCUPIED:

NORMAL OPERATING MODE FOR OCCUPIED SPACES OR DAYTIME OPERATION. WHEN THE UNIT IS IN THE OCCUPIED MODE THE VAV SHALL MAINTAIN THE SPACE
TEMPERATURE AT THE ACTIVE OCCUPIED HEATING OR COOLING SETPOINT. APPLICABLE VENTILATION AND AIRFLOW SETPOINTS SHALL

BE ENFORCED. THE OCCUPIED MODE SHALL BE THE DEFAULT MODE OF THE VAV.

UNOCCUPIED:

NORMAL OPERATING MODE FOR UNOCCUPIED SPACES OR NIGHTTIME OPERATION. WHEN THE UNIT IS IN UNOCCUPIED MODE THE VAV CONTROLLER SHALL MAINTAIN THE
SPACE TEMPERATURE AT THE STORED UNOCCUPIED HEATING OR COOLING SETPOINT REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF A HARDWIRED OR COMMUNICATED SETPOINT.
WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS THE ACTIVE UNOCCUPIED SETPOINT THE VAV SHALL MODULATE FULLY CLOSED.

OCCUPIED BYPASS:

MODE USED TO TEMPORARILY PLACE THE UNIT INTO THE OCCUPIED OPERATION. TENANTS SHALL BE ABLE TO OVERRIDE THE UNOCCUPIED MODE FROM THE SPACE SENSOR.
THE OVERRIDE SHALL LAST FOR A MAXIMUM OF 4 HOURS (ADJ.). THE TENANTS SHALL BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE OVERRIDE FROM THE SPACE SENSOR AT ANY TIME. DURING
THE OVERRIDE THE UNIT SHALL OPERATE IN OCCUPIED MODE.

HEAT/COOL MODE:

THE HEAT/COOL MODE SHALL BE SET BY A COMMUNICATED VALUE OR AUTOMATICALLY BY THE VAV. IN STANDALONE OR AUTO MODE THE VAV SHALL COMPARE THE
PRIMARY AIR TEMPERATURE WITH THE CONFIGURED AUTO CHANGEOVER SETPOINT TO DETERMINE IF THE AIR IS "HOT" OR "COLD". HEATING MODE IT IMPLIES THE PRIMARY
AIR TEMPERATURE IS HOT, COOLING MODE IT IMPLIES THE PRIMARY AIR TEMPERATURE IS COLD,

HEAT/COOL SETPOINT:

THE SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT SHALL BE DETERMINED EITHER BY A LOCAL {E.G., THUMBWHEEL) SETPOINT, THE VAV DEFAULT SETPOINT OR A COMMUNICATED VALUE.
THE VAV SHALL USE THE LOCALLY STORED DEFAULT SETPOINTS WHEN NEITHER A LOCAL SETPOINT NOR COMMUNICATED SETPOINT IS PRESENT. IF BOTH A LOCAL SETPOINT
AND COMMUNICATED SETPOINT EXIST, THE VAV SHALL USE THE COMMUNICATED VALUE.

COOLING MODE:

WHEN THE UNIT IS IN COOLING MODE, THE VAV CONTROLLER SHALL MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE AT THE ACTIVE COOLING SETPOINT BY MODULATING THE AIRFLOW
BETWEEN THE ACTIVE COCLING MINIMUM AIRFLOW SETPOINT TO THE MAXIMUM COOLING AIRFLOW SETPOINT. BASED ON THE VAV CONTROLLER OCCUPANCY MODE, THE
ACTIVE COOLING SETPOINT SHALL BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

SETPOINT DEFAULT VALUE
OCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT 74.0 DEG. F
UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT 85.0 DEG. F
OCCUPIED STANDBY COOLING SETPOINT 78.0 DEG. F

OCCUPIED MIN COOLING AIRFLOW SETPOINT = SEE VAV SCHEDULE
OCCUPIED MAX COOLING AIRFLOW SETPOINT SEE VAV SCHEDULE

THE VAV SHALL USE THE MEASURED SPACE TEMPERATURE AND THE ACTIVE COOLING SETPOINT TO DETERMINE THE REQUESTED COOLING CAPACITY OF THE UNIT. THE
OUTPUTS WILL BE CONTROLLED
BASED ON THE UNIT CONFIGURATION AND THE REQUESTED COOLING CAPACITY.

HEATING MODE:

WHEN THE UNIT IS IN HEATING MODE, THE VAV CONTROLLER SHALL MAINTAIN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE AT THE ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT BY MODULATING THE AIRFLOW
BETWEEN THE ACTIVE HEATING MINIMUM AIRFLOW SETPOINT TO THE MAXIMUM HEATING AIRFLOW SETPOINT. BASED ON THE VAV CONTROLLER OCCUPANCY MODE, THE
ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT SHALL BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

SETPOINT DEFAULT VALUE
OCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT 71.0 DEG. F
UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT 60.0 DEG. F
OCCUPIED STANDBY HEATING SETPOINT 67.0 DEG. F

OCCUPIED MIN HEATING AIRFLOW SETPOINT SEE VAV SCHEDULE
OCCUPIED MAX HEATING AIRFLOW SETPOINT SEE VAV SCHEDULE

THE VAV CONTROLLER SHALL USE THE MEASURED SPACE TEMPERATURE AND THE ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT TO DETERMINE THE REQUESTED HEATING CAPACITY OF THE
UNIT. THE OUTPUTS WILL BE
CONTROLLED BASED ON THE UNIT CONFIGURATION AND THE REQUESTED HEATING CAPACITY.

REHEAT CONTROL:

REHEAT WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED WHEN THE PRIMARY AIR TEMPERATURE |S 5.0 DEG. F BELOW THE CONFIGURED REHEAT ENABLE SETPOINT OF 70.0 DEG. F (ADJ.). THE
REHEAT SHALL BE ENABLED WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW THE ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT AND THE MINIMUM AIRFLOW REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, DURING
REHEAT THE VAV SHALL OPERATE AT ITS MINIMUM HEATING AIRFLOW SETPOINT AND ENERGIZE THE HEAT AS FOLLOWS:

ELECTRIC STAGED:

STAGE 1 IS ENERGIZED WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE FALLS BELOW THE ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT AND MINIMUM AIRFLOW REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. WHEN THE ZONE
TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE

THE ACTIVE HEATING SETPOINT BY 0.5 DEG. F, STAGE 1 IS DE-ENERGIZED.

SPACE SENSOR FAILURE:
IF THERE IS A FAULT WITH THE OPERATION OF THE ZONE SENSOR AN ALARM SHALL BE ANNUNCIATED AT THE BAS. SPACE SENSOR FAILURE SHALL CAUSE THE VAV TO DRIVE
THE DAMPER TO MINIMUM AIR FLOW IF THE VAV IS IN THE OCCUPIED MODE, OR DRIVE IT CLOSED IF THE VAV IS IN THE UNOCCUPIED MODE,
