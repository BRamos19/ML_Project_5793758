Construction

Dick's Sporting Goods General Contractor's scope of work:

e Notify Novar when Dick's Sporting Goods Ethernet is active and operational. This is
required prior to the second visit as Novar commissioning cannot be completed
without it.

e Notified Novar when Dick's Sporting Goods T1 or temporary 4G is active and
operational. This is required prior to the second visit as Novar commissioning cannot
be completed without it.

sensor, and Relative Humidity sensor. Refer to the Dick's Sporting Goods plans for
sensor locations. The EC to also provide a pull string.

If Exhaust Fans are to be controlled based on a time of day, the power should come
from a Square D Powerlink breaker. Novar will program this breaker to operate
based on a time of day (Employee schedule).

If Exhaust Fans are to be interlocked with a Lennox RTU supply air fan, it is the EC's
responsibility to perform this work complete and/or coordinate with the Mechanical
Contractor.

Provide single gang conduit and boxes for each global temperature sensor shown on
the Novar plans. Refer to the mechanical drawings for locations. Refer to Novar
drawings for sensors needed (i.e. show window sensors, data room sensor, unit
heater receiving area sensor, etc.).

Provide single gang conduit and box for thermostat for the unit heater in the receiving
area, MC to provide the thermostat for the unit heater.

Provide conduit stub ups for the Square D communication cable between panels in
the main switch gear (panels A, C and F) to the remote panel BB.

EC to wire programmable breakers for Novar control according to the E5.1 drawings.

Metering: Dick's Sporting Goods wishes to meter the entire buildings energy
consumption. The Electrical Contractor (EC) is responsible for installing the NOVAR
PROVIDED Class 5000 meter complete. Novar will install the low voltage
communication wiring inside the conduit provided by the EC and make the low
voltage communication terminations.

© Novar provided Meter installation: The Novar provided standalone meter is the
main kWh meter that captures the entire buildings energy consumption. The
EC must install the Novar provided meter complete. The meter will be mounted
at the Square D factory inside the powerwall, EC to mount the current
transformers (CT) on the main electrical feeds in the main distribution panel in a
fashion as to capture the entire buildings energy consumption. Identify and
ensure proper phasing and CT direction. Terminate CT wiring to the Novar
provided meter as required. If the CT wiring is not long enough to reach the
meter, the wire can be extended with THHN wiring up to 2000' per CT in
conduit.

NOTE: A box must be added between the electrical panel and the NOVAR

PROVIDED meter. The EC is to install a Novar provided fuse kit for protection of the
NOVAR PROVIDED meter.

e The EC must be onsite at the time of Novar's startup (second trip that occurs two

weeks prior to the construction completion date located on Dick's Sporting Goods
construction schedule) to verify all Metering and CT installation work.

Dick's Sporting Goods Mechanical Contractor's scope of work
e Provide a 24 volt thermostat for control of the unit heater in receiving area.

e If temporary heating and cooling is required, MC is responsible to set up RTUs for

temporary heating/cooling, including providing temporary thermostats, if needed.

General Scope of Work Notes for Novar Installers:
