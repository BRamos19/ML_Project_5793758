joints.

PART 3- EXECUTION
3.1. EXAMINATION

A. Examine joints indicated to receive joint sealants, with Installer present, for compliance with requirements
for joint configuration, installation tolerances, and other conditions affecting performance of the Work. Proceed
with installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.

3.2 PREPARATION

A. Surface Cleaning of Joints: Clean out joints immediately before installing joint sealants to comply with
joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions. Remove all foreign material from joint substrates that could
interfere with adhesion of joint sealant, including dust, paints (except for permanent, protective coatings tested
and approved for sealant adhesion and compatibility by sealant manufacturer), old joint sealants, oil, grease,
waterproofing, water repellents, water, surface dirt, and frost.

1. Clean porous joint substrate surfaces by brushing, grinding, mechanical abrading, or a combination of
these methods to produce a clean, sound substrate capable of developing optimum bond with joint sealants.
Remove loose particles remaining after cleaning operations above by vacuuming or blowing out joints with oil-
free compressed air. Porous joint substrates include the following:

2. Remove laitance and form-release agents from concrete.

3. Clean nonporous joint substrate surfaces with chemical cleaners or other means that do not stain, harm
substrates, or leave residues — capable of interfering with adhesion of joint sealants. Nonporous joint substrates
include the following:

a. Metal.

b. Glass.

c. Porcelain enamel.

d. Glazed surfaces of ceramic tile.

B. Joint Priming: Prime joint substrates where recommended by joint-sealant manufacturer or as indicated by
preconstruction joint- sealant-substrate tests or prior experience. Apply primer to comply with joint-sealant
manufacturer's written instructions. Confine primers to areas of joint-sealant bond; do not allow spillage or
migration onto adjoining surfaces.

C. Masking Tape: Use masking tape where required to prevent contact of sealant or primer with adjoining
surfaces that otherwise would be permanently stained or damaged by such contact or by cleaning methods
required to remove sealant smears. Remove tape immediately after tooling without disturbing joint seal.

3.3 INSTALLATION OF JOINT SEALANTS

A. General: Comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written installation instructions for products and
applications indicated, unless more stringent requirements apply.

B. Sealant Installation Standard: Comply with recommendations in ASTM C 1193 for use of joint sealants as
applicable to materials, applications, and conditions indicated.

C. Install sealant backings of kind indicated to support sealants during application and at position required to
produce cross-sectional shapes and depths of installed sealants relative to joint widths that allow optimum
sealant movement capability.

1. Do not leave gaps between ends of sealant backings.

2. Do not stretch, twist, puncture, or tear sealant backings.

3. Remove absorbent sealant backings that have become wet before sealant application, and replace them
with dry materials.

D. Install bond-breaker tape behind sealants where sealant backings are not used between sealants and backs
of joints.

E. Install sealants using proven techniques that comply with the following and at the same time backings are
installed:

F. Tooling of Nonsag Sealants: Immediately after sealant application and before skinning or curing begins,
tool sealants according to requirements specified in subparagraphs below to form smooth, uniform beads of
configuration indicated; to eliminate air pockets; and to ensure contact and adhesion of sealant with sides of
joint.

3.4 FIELD QUALITY CONTROL

A. Field-Adhesion Testing: Field test joint-sealant adhesion to joint substrates. Record test results in a field-
adhesion-test log. Include dates when sealants were installed, names of persons who installed sealants, test
dates, test locations, whether joints were primed, adhesion results and percent elongations, sealant material,
sealant configuration, and sealant dimensions. Repair sealants pulled from test area by applying new sealants
following same procedures used originally to seal joints. Ensure that original sealant surfaces are clean and that
new sealant contacts original sealant.

B. Evaluation of Field-Adhesion-Test Results: Sealants not evidencing adhesive failure from testing or
noncompliance with other indicated requirements will be considered satisfactory. Remove sealants that fail to
adhere to joint substrates during testing or to comply with other requirements. Retest failed applications until test
results prove sealants comply with indicated requirements.

3.5 CLEANING

A. Clean off excess sealant or sealant smears adjacent to joints as the Work progresses by methods and with
cleaning materials approved in writing by manufacturers of joint sealants and of products in which joints occur.
3.6 PROTECTION

A. Protect joint sealants during and after curing period from contact with contaminating substances and from
damage resulting from construction operations or other causes so sealants are without deterioration or damage at
time of Substantial Completion. If, despite such protection, damage or deterioration occurs, cut out, remove, and
repair damaged or deteriorated joint sealants immediately so installations with repaired areas are
indistinguishable from original work.
