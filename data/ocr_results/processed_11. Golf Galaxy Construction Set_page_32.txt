GENERAL NOTES (cont.)

Special Inspection

1. Special inspection is to be provided in addition to the inspections conducted by the department of
building safety and shall not be construed to relieve the owner or his authorized agent from requesting
the periodic and called inspections required by the applicable building code. Owner shall engage and
pay for a qualified testing agency to perform special inspections.

Required Special Inspections

1. In addition to the regular inspections, the following items will also require special inspection in
accordance with the applicable building code.

Soils compliance prior to foundation inspection (compacting fill, special grading)
Structural concrete over 2,500 psi

Structural steel fabrication

Field welding

High strength bolts

Structural masonry

Cold Formed Steel Deck

QONMOO Dy

2. Special inspector shall meet the qualifications as stated in the applicable building code and shall
perform the duties and responsibilities as outlined in the applicable building code. The special inspector
shall provide written documentation to the building official demonstrating his or her competence and
relevant experience or training. Experience or training shall be considered relevant when the
documented experience or training is related in complexity to the same type of special inspection
activities for projects of similar complexity and material qualities. These qualifications are in addition to
qualifications specified in others sections of the applicable building code.

3. Special inspection shall meet the requirements of the applicable building code. Special inspector(s) shall
be hired by the owner to perform the required special inspections. The names of persons or firms who
are to perform the special inspections shall be forwarded to the bullding official for approval. The special
inspector(s) shall complete and submit all forms required by the building department having jurisdiction.

4. Access for special inspection: The construction or work for which special inspection is required shall
remain accessible and exposed for special inspection purposes until completion of the required special
inspections.

5. The special inspector(s) shall:

A. Observe the work assigned for conformance to the approved drawing and specifications.

B. Furnish inspection reports to the engineer of record and building department. Discrepancies shall
be brought to the immediate attention of the contractor for correction, then, if not corrected to the
engineer and the building department.

C. Submit to the engineer of record and the building department a signed final report stating that the
work was in conformance with the approved drawings and specifications and the applicable
workmanship provisions of the applicable building code.

6. Special Inspection Notes:

A. Continuous special inspection is always required during the performance of the work unless
specifically noted below.

B. Where fabrication of structural load-bearing members and assemblies is being performed on the
premises of a fabricator's shop, continuous special inspection is required during the performance
of the work except as allowed in the applicable building code and unless specifically noted below.

C. It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide the special inspector(s) with advance notice, no
less than one working day, of the initiation of any work required to have special inspections. All
work performed without required special inspection will be subject to removal.

7. Types of work requiring special inspections are:

A. Structural steel elements of buildings and structures as required by AISC 360 as referenced in
the applicable building code, see Table 1.
1. Exceptions include:

a. Special Inspection of steel fabrication process shall not be required where the
fabricator does not perform any welding, thermal cutting or heating operation of any
kind as part of the fabrication process. In such cases, the fabricator shall be required
to submit a detailed procedure for material control that demonstrates the fabricator's
ability to maintain suitable records and procedures such that, at any time during the
fabrication process, the material specification, and grade for the main stress-carrying
elements are capable of being determined. Mill test reports shall be identifiable to the
main stress-carrying elements required by the approved construction documents.

B. Cold formed steel deck as required by SDI (Steel Deck Institute) QA/QC as reference in the
applicable building code,see Table 2.

C. Open web steel joists and joist girders as required per Table 3.

D. Concrete construction as required by applicable building code and Table 4. Exceptions are as
follows:
1. Concrete patios, driveways and sidewalks, on grade.

E. Masonry construction as required in the applicable building code and Table 5, Level 2, special
inspection, except as allowed in the applicable building code.

F. Special inspection for existing site soil conditions, during site preparation and fill placement, to
ensure load-bearing requirements in compliance with applicable building code and Table 7 except
as allowed in applicable building code.

8. Additional types of work requiring special inspections for wind resistance defined as wind Exposure
Category B, where the allowable design wind speed (Vagp) is 120 miles per hour (155 mph ultimate) or
greater or wind Exposure Category C or D, where allowable wind speed (Vasp) is 110 mph (142 mph
ultimate) or greater.

A. Wind-resisting components periodic special inspection is required for the following system and
components.
1. Roof covering, roof deck and roof framing connections.
2. Exterior wall covering and wall connections to roof and floor diaphragms and framing.
