REASON OF LACK OF FAMILIARITY ON THE PART OF THE CONTRACTOR WITH ACTUAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, REQUIREMENTS, AND PRACTICES AT THE SITE.

CONTRACTOR SHALL NOTE THE CRITICAL SPACE AVAILABLE ABOVE CEILINGS. PROVIDE TRANSITION PIECES AT CROSSOVERS, UNDER BEAMS, OVER/UNDER PIPES, AS
REQUIRED TO ACCOMMODATE DUCTS WITHIN SPACE AVAILABLE, PROVIDING EQUIVALENT DUCT SIZE TO THE SIZE SHOWN. COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH OTHER TRADES TO
REDUCE THE NECESSITY FOR TRANSITIONS TO A MINIMUM. NO ADDITIONAL COSTS WILL BE PAID FOR ANY REQUIRED TRANSITIONS OR OTHER SPECIAL CHANGE SHAPE
PIECES. WHERE CONNECTING FLEXIBLE DUCTWORK TO CEILING DIFFUSERS AND CEILING REGISTERS, SIZE OF FLEXIBLE DUCT SHALL BE SAME SIZE AS NECK OF CEILING
DIFFUSER OR CEILING REGISTER.

THE MECHANICAL WORK INCLUDES DEMOLITION OF PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING HVAC SYSTEM. REFER TO DRAWINGS FOR EXTENT.

PROVIDE TEST, ADJUSTMENT, AND BALANCE OF ALL EXISTING HVAC EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS AFTER ALL WORK HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. TAB WORK PERFORMED FOR
WORK UNDER THIS CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SINGLE DUCT VAV, GRILLES, REGISTERS, AND DIFFUSERS. TAB WORK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF "NEBB". PROVIDE THREE COPIES OF THE FINAL REPORT.

ALL MECHANICAL DUCTWORK, ETC., SHALL BE SUPPORTED AS INDICATED OR SPECIFIED. PROVIDE ALL SUPPORTS, CONNECTIONS, CONTROLS, AND ACCESSORIES WHETHER
OR NOT SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT. ALL MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT, DUCTWORK PIPING, ETC., SHALL BE SUPPORTED AS INDICATED OR SPECIFIED. ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS
SHALL BE PROVIDED AS REQUIRED TO ENSURE A VIBRATION FREE INSTALLATION AND SHALL COMPLY WITH LOCAL BUILDING CODE.

DESIGN BASIS: THE MECHANICAL DRAWINGS AND PLANS ARE DIAGRAMMATIC AND ARE BASED ON THE MANUFACTURER AND MODEL NUMBER OF THE MECHANICAL
EQUIPMENT AND DEVICES AS SCHEDULED. THE DRAWINGS ARE NOT INTENDED TO SHOW EVERY ITEM IN ITS EXACT LOCATION, THE EXACT DIMENSIONS, OR ALL DETAILS
NECESSARY FOR THE EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COORDINATE ALL HVAC EQUIPMENT AND NEW DUCTWORK WITH ALL OTHER NEW WORK, WITH
THE EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WITH THE WORK OF OTHER TRADES. IF FIELD CONDITIONS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE SHOWN ON THE DRAWINGS AND AFFECT THE
MECHANICAL WORK, INFORM THE ENGINEER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE WORK INVOLVED.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE WORK EACH DAY, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CLEAN THE PREMISES AND REMOVE AND DISPOSE OF ALL DEBRIS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS WORK. THE
JOBSITE AND PROJECT WORK AREAS SHALL BE LEFT IN A CONDITION ACCEPTABLE TO THE OWNER. THE BUILDING IS TO REMAIN OCCUPIED DURING THE WORK EFFORT,
COORDINATE WITH OWNER FOR TIMES WORK CAN OCCUR.

. PROVIDE ALL DUCT AND PIPING FITTINGS, OFFSETS, AND TRANSITIONS, AS REQUIRED FOR A COMPLETE INSTALLATION. ALL DUCTWORK SIZES SHOWN ARE CLEAR INSIDE

DIMENSIONS.

. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL MAINTAIN A RECORD SET OF DRAWINGS ON THE PROJECT SITE AND SHALL MARK THIS SET TO MAKE RECORD OF ALL CHANGES MADE IN THE

INSTALLATION OF THE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE A WRITTEN WARRANTY TO REPLACE ALL FAULTY MATERIALS AND/OR LABOR, AT NO
ADDITIONAL COST TO THE BUILDING OWNER, FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF OWNER ACCEPTANCE.

. DAMAGE TO OTHER WORK: REPAIR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS SECTION TO WORK OF OTHER SECTIONS. DAMAGE TO FIREPROOFING: REPAIR ANY DAMAGED

FIREPROOFING CAUSED BY THIS SECTION TO INTEGRITY OF ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION. INSULATION: FURNISH INSULATION FOR ALL EQUIPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
THAT PERMIT HEAT LOSS OR GAIN OR WILL FORM CONDENSATION. REPLACE ANY DAMAGED OR REMOVED INSULATION ON EXISTING SYSTEMS, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL
SUBMIT AN ADD ALTERNATE PRICE FOR DUCTWORK INSULATION REPAIRS WITH HIS BID.

. PROVIDE THE ENGINEER WITH SIX (6) COPIES OF SUBMITTALS FOR APPROVAL FOR ALL EQUIPMENT, SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS, AND DEVICES AS INDICATED HEREIN. SUBMIT

PRODUCT AND PERFORMANCE DATA FOR EQUIPMENT, CONTROLS, DEVICES, AND FOR EACH ITEM OF EQUIPMENT. PROVIDE TWO-LINE DUCTWORK SHOP DRAWINGS FOR ALL
HVAC DUCTWORK SYSTEMS. PROVIDE COMMISSIONING REPORT FOR AUTOMATIC CONTROLS FOR HVAC SYSTEMS.

RENOVATION/DEMOLITION NOTES

THIS CONTRACTOR SHALL VISIT THE SITE AND ADJOINING AREAS AND EXAMINE THE EXISTING CONDITIONS TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THEM AND TO DETERMINE THE
DIFFICULTIES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK OF THIS CONTRACT. THIS CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THIS PRIOR TO THE SUBMISSION OF HIS PROPOSAL.
SUBMISSION OF A PROPOSAL WILL BE CONSTRUED AS EVIDENCE THAT SUCH AN EXAMINATION HAS BEEN MADE AND LATER CLAIMS WILL NOT BE RECOGNIZED FOR EXTRA LABOR,
EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS REQUIRED BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN FORESEEN HAD SUCH AN EXAMINATION BEEN MADE.

THE DEMOLITION WORK SHALL INCLUDE, PROVIDING ALL MATERIALS, ALL NECESSARY EXTENSIONS, CONNECTIONS, CUTTING, REPAIRING, ADAPTING AND OTHER MECHANICAL
WORK REQUIRED, TOGETHER WITH ANY REQUIRED TEMPORARY CONNECTIONS TO MAINTAIN SERVICE PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE PERMANENT WORK. NOTES AND
GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION SHALL NOT LIMIT THE EXTENT OF DEMOLITION REQUIRED. EXTENT OF DEMOLITION WORK SHALL BE COORDINATED WITH THE ARCHITECT AND
BUILDING MANAGEMENT.

COORDINATE ALL EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEM SHUT DOWNS AND DRAIN DOWNS WITH BUILDING MANAGEMENT AND PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF 48 HOUR NOTICE.

ALL MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT REMOVED AS A RESULT OF DEMOLITION ACTIVITIES SHALL BE TAKEN FROM THE SITE AND DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE
LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

REMOVE ALL EXISTING DUCT, AIR TERMINALS, AND EQUIPMENT, WHETHER SPECIFICALLY INDICATED OR NCT, AS REQUIRED DUE TO THE ARCHITECTURAL AND MECHANICAL
DEMOLITION WORK IN THE AREA TO BE RENOVATED. ALL EQUIPMENT THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED AND IS NOT REUSED SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE OWNER, OR DISPOSED OF AS
DIRECTED BY THE OWNER'S REPRESENTATIVE.

FIELD VERIFY EXISTING DUCTWORK AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY TO THE DUCT SHOWN ON THE PLANS, AS REQUIRED BY FIELD CONDITIONS.

COORDINATE ALL DEMOLITION WORK WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS TO ASSURE THAT EXISTING EQUIPMENT, THAT IS REQUIRED FOR A COMPLETE AND OPERABLE SYSTEM IS NOT
REMOVED.

ALL EXISTING MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT, DUCT AND PIPING THAT INTERFERE WITH ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION SHALL BE RELOCATED OR RE-ROUTED AS REQUIRED TO CLEAR THE
NEW CONSTRUCTION. RECONNECT ALL EXISTING EQUIPMENT THAT ARE TO REMAIN AND NOT AFFECTED BY THE NEW CONSTRUCTION, TO THE NEWLY RELOCATED OR RE-ROUTED
SYSTEM TO ENSURE A SAFE AND OPERATIONAL SYSTEM.

DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT THE EXISTING MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTRUCTION MODIFICATIONS.

IF ANY SUPPLY, RETURN, OR OUTDOOR AIR DUCTWORK IS FOUND TO BE LEAKING, BLOWN OUT, OR HAS BROKEN INSULATION, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL SUBMIT AN ADD ALTERNATE PRICE FOR DUCTWORK REPAIRS WITH HIS BID.

CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE TEMPORARY PROTECTION TO ANY EXPOSED OR UNCAPPED NEW OR EXISTING DUCTWORK OR PIPING TO REMAIN, TO MINIMIZE DUST
CONTAMINATION IN ANY AND ALL OF THE AIR AND WATER SYSTEMS. THIS SHALL INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO TEMPORARY FILTERS, CAPS, ENCLOSURES, ETC.
